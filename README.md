## Micro Project

Micro Project is a social networking website where people can add new friends.

# User Features

A user can see its pending requests , can send friend request and can accept friend request. A user can find more friends by going to Find Friends.

# User Profile

A user has a profile, anyone can see the profile but there is restriction to what content a user can see. The public profile will have all the basic info about the user. But if user is a friend then user can also see friends list of the user. 

# UI

UI is very basic. I have used HTML , CSS , JS for frontend with jQuery and Bootstrap. For the backend I have used NodeJs with MongoDB.

# Searching for a user

There is also an option to search for users by username , firstname or lastname. I have implemented a fuzzy search. An automatic suggestion box is implemented for username search using AJAX and jQuery.
